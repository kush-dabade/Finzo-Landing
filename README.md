Finzo — Fintech Landing Page
============================

Finzo is a modern fintech landing page focused on **clarity, restraint, and trust**.The goal of this project was not to maximize features, but to design a calm, intentional financial experience that communicates value without overwhelming the user.

This is a **frontend-only project**, built as a product-style landing page rather than a full SaaS.

*   Subtle motion and effects used intentionally
    
*   WebGL-based animated background for visual depth
    
*   Responsive layout across screen sizes
    
*   Simple, honest pricing presentation

The structure is designed to keep **layout, page sections, effects, and reusable UI clearly separated**, making the codebase easy to understand and scale.


🎯 Purpose of the Project
-------------------------

This project was built to:

*   Practice **product-oriented UI design**
    
*   Improve **visual hierarchy, spacing, and layout**
    
*   Explore **motion and WebGL effects** responsibly
    
*   Create a **portfolio-ready frontend project** with clean architecture
    

It is intentionally **not** a backend-powered application.

📌 Status
